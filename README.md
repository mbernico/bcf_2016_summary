While our most attended race might have been a CX race, that *isn't* our **favorite** discipline.  The BCF race team loves to play in the dirt!  Braaaap! Braaaap!

## Roadies or Dirtbags?

Who wins more?  *Roadies* or *Dirtbags*?

It looks like the Dirtbags get the most wins, but neither can out win the Triathletes.

## But what about those of us with advanced experience?

Masters is tough, and those of us with **experience** are winning *slighly* less frequently.
